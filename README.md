# Coding Problems & Tests

## Description
    
In this repo, I aim to solve coding challenges using the tools I have learned so far in my programming journey. As I continue to learn more, my goal is to solve these challenges and future problems in a more efficient and modern manner. Along with solving the problems, I have written out tests using jest to ensure my functions are correctly solving them.
