# Coding Problems & Tests

## Description
    
In this repo, I aim to solve coding challenges using the tools I have learned so far in my programming journey. As I continue to learn more, I will solve these challenges and future problems in a more efficient and modern manner. Along with solving these problems, I have written out tests using Jest to ensure my code is working as expected.

My goal is to challenge myself to be able to think logically as a programmer, and to better prepare myself for the challenges and situations I might face in my programming career.

## Examples of Problems

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.
If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

<br>
Write a function that takes in an array of two strings. The function returns true if the string in the first element of the array contains all of the letters of the string in the second element of the array.

<br>
Write a function that performs a search and replace on the sentence using the arguments provided and return the new sentence.
Bonus: Preserve the case of the first character in the original word when you are replacing it. For example if you mean to replace the word "Book" with the word "dog", it should be replaced as "Dog".
